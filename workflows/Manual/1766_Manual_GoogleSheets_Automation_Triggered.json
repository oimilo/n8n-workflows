Then I took it further and thought that I could make automated virtual receptionist for my company which I did which makes life better because when I am on a job I miss probably a few calls a day and then when I try to reach them back, they usually have already started to talk to other competitors and then it gets challenging from there.  So this has been my solution and now I never miss a call and started building automations to even sell for me on my products and services that I offer and now even can send a booking link to them by text and email and this has allowed me to convert better and not miss an opportunity that comes my way.  I say all this because I created another on that is used strictly to role play with and I need testers to help me refine and debug it.  Essentially I just need other business owners to role play with my agent and provide any feedback that would make it better or enhance it.  \n\nIf you're willing to help me test it just call 1-855-449-7005.

This is absolutely critical - your financial data is too important to risk losing. The timing couldn't be worse in the middle of the holidays and so close to year-end... and the lack of advance warning is frustrating.\n\nI know this situation will leave many business owners scrambling for a new bookkeeping solution. But don’t stress—there are excellent alternatives out there that can serve you even better!\n\nI primarily wanted to make this post to alert people of the closure (in case you missed the email) and encourage everyone to secure their data ASAP. If you're looking for a reliable path forward, I'd recommend exploring smaller firms or individual remote bookkeepers. Many offer highly personalized services at a wide range of prices - with services often far better quality than Bench.\n\nI'm not here to promote my business, but if you're feeling overwhelmed or don't know where to start, I'm happy to chat and share advice based on my experience running a remote bookkeeping and accounting firm. At the end of the day, I hope all Bench clients find a bookkeeping service that's a better fit: personalized, reliable, and capable of supporting your business long-term.\n\n  \nTo add a question and make sure I'm following the sub rules: \n\nWhat are you currently doing for your bookkeeping and accounting? How did you find that solution and what do you wish was different about it?",
