        "postcontent": "Hello!  \nLongtime friends have offered to sell my their local biz.    \n12 years running, last year did 950k gross, 325K SDE.  \nYOY growth has been good.  \n650k price.  \nThey have offered to seller finance up to 61.5% of the purchase price so far.  \nThey might go even higher on the seller financing if I ask.\n\n**The good (about me):**  \n  \n\\- I have good credit, probably 720+.  \n\\- I do have \\~200k equity in my home, I'm willing to collateralize.  \n  \n**The ugly (about me):**  \n  \n\\- I have only 5% down possible for equity injection, but would prefer 0%  \nI read that with a SBA 7(a) loan the seller can do 5% of my equity injection with a standby note (deferred payment until SBA loan is paid off).  I'm not sure if that could be done in tandem with another (much larger) note that would be payable (in payments) at closing.  \n  \n\\- I've had no / negative income the last couple of years.  I took some time off from my 20+ year profession, lived off of savings and some credit while I explored other career paths because I needed a change.  I did learn a couple of high value trades, and did incur some expenses in that process.\n\n\\- No direct industry experience.  I do have much professional experience I bring to the table, but not in this industry.  I have managed people on my team... but not employees.  \n\n**The rest:**  \n  \nThey are willing to hire me as store manager now, if that helps.    \nThey will be providing complete training and ongoing support.  \nIt is a simple business, really.  \nThey obviously believe in their business, given the willingness to seller finance so much of it.  \n  \nWhat are the odds I could get a SBA 7(a) loan with 5% down?  \nAre there any loans with 0% down?  \n  \nI would like to get an extra 50k or so for startup costs - it is an acquisition however I'm going to have startup expenses like first and last months lease payments, jurisdictional inspections, electricity deposit, liability insurance / workman's comp, that sort of stuff.\n\nI realize the scenario is not ideal, however it seems to me there should be SOME option out there given that all I have to do is not mess up the business!  It's a great business, well loved in the community.  \nThere is good room in the revenue for me to make accelerated loan repayments, establish business savings, grow the business, and even pay myself enough to cover my living expenses.  That is one heck of a deal, I have to find some way to pull this off!\n\nI'm willing to look at less fantastic loan offers with higher rates.    \nIt really seems to me that some entity would be willing to lend based on the cashflow / success / stability of the existing business.\n\nOne idea I had - if sellers would be willing to carry 100% for 12-24 months, would I then likely have an easier time qualifying for a SBA 7(a) loan to pay off their note, or part of it (depending on what they want)?\n\nAnother idea - store manager -&gt; partner -&gt; partner buyout  \nI do need to find out their maximum timeline for getting out.  \n  \nHad I known a couple of years ago this was going to come up, I would have made different decisions!  \nI really don't want to sell my house and rent something in order to do this, but I'm considering that as a last resort.  \nIf these weren't my longtime friends whom I trust with my life, I wouldn't consider this.  I'd be too chicken.  This is like winning the lottery to me, frankly... I'm not the perfect buyer on paper but they really want me to have it.  They know it will be my baby, as it has been theirs.\n\nGrateful for any solutions / ideas, thank you in advance!  =D\n\n",

Then I took it further and thought that I could make automated virtual receptionist for my company which I did which makes life better because when I am on a job I miss probably a few calls a day and then when I try to reach them back, they usually have already started to talk to other competitors and then it gets challenging from there.  So this has been my solution and now I never miss a call and started building automations to even sell for me on my products and services that I offer and now even can send a booking link to them by text and email and this has allowed me to convert better and not miss an opportunity that comes my way.  I say all this because I created another on that is used strictly to role play with and I need testers to help me refine and debug it.  Essentially I just need other business owners to role play with my agent and provide any feedback that would make it better or enhance it.  \n\nIf you're willing to help me test it just call 1-855-449-7005.

If you're looking for a reliable path forward, I'd recommend exploring smaller firms or individual remote bookkeepers. Many offer highly personalized services at a wide range of prices - with services often far better quality than Bench.\n\nI'm not here to promote my business, but if you're feeling overwhelmed or don't know where to start, I'm happy to chat and share advice based on my experience running a remote bookkeeping and accounting firm. At the end of the day, I hope all Bench clients find a bookkeeping service that's a better fit: personalized, reliable, and capable of supporting your business long-term.\n\n  \nTo add a question and make sure I'm following the sub rules: \n\nWhat are you currently doing for your bookkeeping and accounting? How did you find that solution and what do you wish was different about it?",
